# simple-rust-game

The result of following https://sunjay.dev/learn-game-dev/intro.html, plus my own work:
1. Intersection avoidance: no two entities can overlap (collision detection); no entity can pass the window borders.
2. Dull text rendering.
3. The player (only the player) can consume the items on the screen.
